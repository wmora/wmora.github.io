If you want to change the screen brightness in Ubuntu (I canâ€™t change it using the keyboard shortcuts or the Ubuntu Power Management menu), open a terminal and execute the following:

```bash
sudo setpci -s 00:02.0 F4.B=xx
```

Where xx is the desired brightness in hex ranging from 0 (brightest) to FF (no brightness at all). I usually change it to CA when working on battery.

Cheers!
