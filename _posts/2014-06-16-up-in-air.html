Since <a href="http://www.williammora.com/2014/06/im-joining-one-game-month.html" target="_blank">I decided to join one game a month</a>,&nbsp;I need to come up with new ideas. Having the world cup this time around, I put myself in "hackathon mode" and developed <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.gamestudio24.upintheair.android" target="_blank">Up in the Air</a>&nbsp;over a weekend. It's very simple (yes, even more simple than&nbsp;<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.gamestudio24.cityescape.android" target="_blank">Martian Run!</a>) but I really had a lot of fun playing around with the physics involved.<br /><br />In case you are wondering, the game is done with&nbsp;<a href="http://libgdx.badlogicgames.com/" target="_blank">libGDX</a>.<br /><br />Hope you like it!
