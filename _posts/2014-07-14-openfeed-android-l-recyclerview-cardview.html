With Google's announcement of the new version of&nbsp;<a href="http://www.androidauthority.com/android-l-release-official-397212/">Android (codename L)</a>&nbsp;last month. I installed the <a href="https://developer.android.com/preview/setup-sdk.html" target="_blank">preview SDK</a> on my Nexus 5 and all of my apps worked pretty good except for Twitter which would not even open.<br /><br />I decided to create an app to make use of the new&nbsp;<a href="https://developer.android.com/preview/material/ui-widgets.html"><code>RecyclerView</code>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<code>CardView</code></a>&nbsp;widgets along with the new&nbsp;<a href="https://developer.android.com/preview/material/index.html" target="_blank">Material theme</a>. Since Twitter didn't work on my phone, I started my own client:&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/wmora/openfeed" target="_blank">OpenFeed</a>. It's a work in progress and its functionality will be limited since Twitter's API does not provide everything I need (i.e. I can't load a conversation thread).<br /><br />Feel free to&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/wmora/openfeed" target="_blank">browse through the code</a>, download the project and run it on your emulator or device. Let me know what you think in the comments section.
