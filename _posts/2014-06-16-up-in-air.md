Since [I decided to join one game a month](http://www.williammora.com/2014/06/im-joining-one-game-month.html), I need to come up with new ideas. Having the world cup this time around, I put myself in "hackathon mode" and developed [Up in the Air](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.gamestudio24.upintheair.android) over a weekend. It's very simple (yes, even more simple than [Martian Run!](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.gamestudio24.cityescape.android)) but I really had a lot of fun playing around with the physics involved.

In case you are wondering, the game is done with [libGDX](http://libgdx.badlogicgames.com/).

Hope you like it!
