If you have ever used the Oracle import utility, your database has system generated constraint names (ex: <code>SYS_C00641321</code>), and you did not specify CONSTRAINTS=N during the import then chances are you have duplicate constraints for pretty much every constraint except for any PRIMARY KEY, FOREIGN KEY and user generated constraint names.  I recently stumbled upon a database that had performance issues and one of the things I noticed was that almost every single constraint was repeated up to 10 times. Most of the duplicates were <code>NOT NULL</code> constraints, which is kind of expected since people tend to create <code>NOT NULL</code> constraints anonymously such as the following:  <pre>CREATE TABLE tab1<br />(col1  VARCHAR(2) NOT NULL,<br />col2  VARCHAR(30) NOT NULL);</pre> That statement will create 2 NOT NULL constraints with a system generated name (ex: <code>SYS_C00641322</code> and <code>SYS_C00641323</code>). If the schema that owns that table is exported and then imported to another schema, it will create two additional <code>NOT NULL</code> constraints since it recreates the table running the exact same command shown above.  That could be prevented by having user generated constraint names:  <pre>CREATE TABLE tab1<br />(col1  VARCHAR(2) CONSTRAINT COL1_NN NOT NULL,<br />col2  VARCHAR(30) CONSTRAINT COL2_NN NOT NULL);</pre> If the schema that owns that table is exported and then imported to another schema, it does not create duplicate any constraints since the system is forced to specify the constraint name at table creation.  Here is my script to identify the duplicate constraints and then generate a script to drop those unnecessary constraints. The logic is to create two temporary tables: One that lists all the constraints (except for PRIMARY KEY and FOREIGN KEY constraints) that should be in the database and another table where I put all the necessary information for the constraints that need to be dropped. Once the table DUMP_CONSTRAINTS is populated, a script is generated to drop all those constraints. Finally, I dropped the temporary tables that I used: <pre><br />CREATE GLOBAL TEMPORARY TABLE temp_constraints<br />(table_name       varchar2(30),<br />constraint_name  varchar2(30),<br />search_condition varchar2(2000),<br />CONSTRAINT temp_constraints_pk PRIMARY KEY (table_name, search_condition))<br />/<br />CREATE GLOBAL TEMPORARY TABLE dump_constraints<br />(table_name       varchar2(30),<br />constraint_name  varchar2(30),<br />search_condition varchar2(2000))<br />/<br />DECLARE<br />tabName   VARCHAR2(30)    := NULL;<br />conName   VARCHAR2(30)    := NULL;<br />seaCond   VARCHAR2(2000)  := NULL;<br />CURSOR c_cursor IS<br />   SELECT table_name,constraint_name,search_condition<br />   FROM user_constraints<br />   WHERE constraint_type NOT IN ('P','R')<br />   AND search_condition IS NOT NULL<br />   ORDER BY table_name;<br />BEGIN<br />  dbms_output.enable(null); -- To prevent a buffer overflow<br />  FOR c IN c_cursor LOOP<br />  BEGIN<br />     tabName := c.table_name;<br />     conName := c.constraint_name;<br />     seaCond := c.search_condition;<br />     INSERT INTO temp_constraints values(tabName,conName,seaCond);<br />     EXCEPTION<br />     WHEN DUP_VAL_ON_INDEX THEN<br />      BEGIN<br />       INSERT INTO dump_constraints values(tabName,conName,seaCond);<br /> END;<br />     WHEN OTHERS THEN dbms_output.put_line('Another exception: '||tabName<br />||' Search condition: '||seaCond);  -- For debugging purposes<br />   END;<br />END LOOP;<br />END;<br />/<br />SPOOL 'C:\dump_duplicate_constraints'.sql<br />SET verify OFF<br />SET pages 0<br />SET serveroutput ON<br />SELECT 'ALTER TABLE '||table_name||' DROP CONSTRAINT '||constraint_name||';'<br />FROM dump_constraints;<br />/<br />SPOOL OFF<br />SET pages 10000<br />DROP TABLE temp_constraints CASCADE CONSTRAINTS;<br />/<br />DROP TABLE dump_constraints CASCADE CONSTRAINTS;<br />/</pre> So, how to prevent this from ever happening again? You could either: 1) Make sure that an import does not import any constraints (just set CONSTRAINTS=N when importing) 2) Make sure you properly name ALL constraints. Do not let the system generate a constraint name for you (like previously mentioned)  I hope this helps anyone out there. Feel free to leave a comment if you have any questions.
