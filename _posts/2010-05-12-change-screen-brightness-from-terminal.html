<p>If you want to change the screen brightness in Ubuntu (I canâ€™t change it using the keyboard shortcuts or the Ubuntu Power Management menu), open a terminal and execute the following:</p>  <p><code>sudo setpci -s 00:02.0 F4.B=xx</code></p>  <p>Where xx is the desired brightness in hex ranging from 0 (brightest) to FF (no brightness at all). I usually change it to CA when working on battery.</p>  <p>Cheers!</p>  <p></p>
